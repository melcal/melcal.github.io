    <h2>About eChats</h2>

    <p>
     Technology consistently changes the way we think about the world at a pace never seen before. Created by Kellogg students for Kellogg students, the Kellogg eChats series provides MBA candidates with an opportunity to meet leading thought leaders. The monthly series affords students an opportunity to learn from these leaders on topics such as wearables, bitcoin, and other such topics that are changing the way we interact with technology and pose their own questions.

  <h3>Katie says...</h3>
  <p>Best Movie Ever! This is not like any Marvel film we have seen. It's incredible. The visuals in this film are literally out of this world. The comedy is spot on and Chris Pratt is hilarious! Nothing like it. Ever. I'm positive I'm going to see this movie again.</p>

  <h3>Brian says...</h3>
  <p>Meh.</p>
